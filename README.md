Lab 4

<strong>implement a Queue ADT using arrayed based, linked list, or the standard Java class Vector.</strong>

Create a test driver, such as the Waiting Time simulation (Chapter 7) to test your queue implementation.  I am also sharing a sample driver (WaitLine) for your considerations.

Upload your Queue ADT and test driver to your GitHub repository.

Complete a 1-page write-up to highlight your learning experience, including a screenshot of your GitHub repository.

Compress your working folder and write-up; submit compressed file back to the assignment link on Blackboard.
